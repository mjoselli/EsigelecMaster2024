// Open in https://play.kotlinlang.org/ and respond to:

// 1. Create a function that takes an integer and returns true if the number is even and false otherwise. 

// 2. Create a function that receives an array of integers and returns the largest number. 

// 3. Create a class called "Person" with attributes "name" and "age". Then create a list of "Person" objects and sort the list alphabetically by the "name" attribute. 

// 4. Create a function that takes a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome (that is, it can be read the same way backwards). 

// 5. Implement a lambda function that returns the greater of two numbers.

// 6. Create a class "ContaBankaria" with the attributes "balance" and "limit". Add a method called "withdraw" that takes a value as a parameter and subtracts it from the account balance. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the account balance, the method must throw an exception with the message "Insufficient balance". 

// 7. Create a function that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string in the list.

// 8. Create an "Employee" class with the attributes "name", "age" and "salary". Create a function that takes a list of employees and returns the employee with the highest salary. 

// 9. Create a function that receives a list of integers and returns a list with the numbers in ascending order, without using the language's sorting method.

// 10. Create a "Triangle" class with the attributes "base" and "height". Add a method called "area" that calculates and returns the area of ​​the triangle.

// 11. Create a function that receives a list of strings and returns a list of all strings that begin with the letter "A", in alphabetical order.

// 12. Use a map to represent a dictionary of words and their translations.

// 13. Create a higher order function called operationMath that accepts two numbers and a lambda function. The operacaoMatematica function must apply the lambda function to the two numbers and return the result. Then create some lambda functions to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use the higher order function to perform these operations with different pairs of numbers.

//14. Create an extension function called isPalindrome for the String class that checks whether the string is a palindrome. The function must ignore whitespace and be case-insensitive. Then use this function to check whether some words are palindromes.

//15. Let's create a program that uses high-order functions to operate on an array of integers. You must create high-order functions to perform the following operations: filterPares: A function that filters and returns only even numbers in the array; doubleValues: A function that doubles the value of each number in the array; sumValues: A function that calculates the sum of all values ​​in the array. Then, create an array of integers and use high-order functions to perform these operations.
