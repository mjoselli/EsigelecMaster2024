# In-class Exercisees:

## Exercise 1: Figma
- Think of an app that you would like to build.
- Build the screens of an App with Android Studio (minimum 3);
- Use components of android

- Delivery at: [link to delivery](https://www.dropbox.com/request/snIgwDPJUk6BLkqndNXn) or share with mejoselli@gmail.com
- Deliver date: before the last day of class.

## Exercise 2: Adding Pokemon Stats to the App
- Expand the existing Pokemon app (PokeApplication.zip) to display the base stats of a Pokemon, including HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
- Delivery at: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/j4LqBONi1rl9ydyLiKfn) or share the github project with mjoselli. Make sure to include the code and include a screenshot of the app.
- Hint: You need to change the Layout.xml, PokemonData to hold the new data, and the MainActivity to populate the new views.

## Exercise 2: Profile Screen with Composer
- Create the following screen using Android Jetpack Compose

## Final Project
- Project Description:
This project involves developing an Android application that demonstrates proficiency in key Android development concepts. Students will be tasked with:
1. Interface Design:
    * Choice of Implementation: Students will have the flexibility to design and implement the application's user interface using either traditional Android Views (XML layouts) or Jetpack Compose.
    * User Experience: The interface should be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing, providing a seamless user experience.
    * Multiple Screens: The application must incorporate at least two distinct screens, showcasing the ability to navigate between different parts of the application.
2. Data Fetching:
    * API Consumption: The application will interact with an external API (e.g., a public weather API, a news API, a movie database API) to retrieve data.
    * Data Handling: Students will learn to handle API responses, parse the data, and display it appropriately within the application.
    * Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms should be implemented to gracefully handle potential network issues, API errors, and data parsing problems.
3. Android Fundamentals:
    * Activities/Fragments: Students will demonstrate an understanding of Activities and Fragments (if applicable) for managing the application's flow.
    * Lifecycle Management: Proper handling of the Android Activity/Fragment lifecycle is crucial to prevent memory leaks and ensure smooth application behavior.
    * Testing: Basic unit tests or UI tests are encouraged to validate the functionality of specific components.
- Project Suggestions:
* Weather App: A classic choice that aligns well with the project requirements. Students can fetch weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather) and display information such as current conditions, forecasts, and weather maps.
* News Reader: An app that fetches news articles from various sources, allowing users to browse headlines, read articles, and potentially save articles for later reading.
* Movie Database: An application that displays movie information, such as titles, posters, ratings, and plot summaries, fetched from a movie database API (e.g., The Movie Database (TMDb)).
